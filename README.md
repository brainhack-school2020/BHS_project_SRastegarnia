# Brain_decoding
Brain decoding or mind-reading using neuroimaging data has been an active topic for years. It is a neuroscience field that concerned about different types of stimuli from information that has already been encoded and represented in the brain by networks of neurons. 
## Summary
## Backgroung and the project definition
I am a first year Master student at Université de Montréal. 
For the Brainhack School 2020 project I would like to work on the brain decoding model using an open-source dataset (Haxby) in order to evaluate decoding accuracy. (I am still not sure which model I am going to use!)
The goals of this project are:
•	Getting familiar with a brain decoding process in Python
•	Writing a Python-based machine learning/deep learning codes for this approach
•	Analyzing the results and see the difference for the different model using python plot
•	Moreover, trying to integrate as much as tools I was introduced during training week.
I would like to work with other people, so please feel free to contact me!
The README file will be updated daily!

### Tools
Python github and other tools which I am learning during braihack school
### Data
For brainhack school project i will use Haxby et al. (2001) data set which is a block-design fMRI dataset from a study on face & object representation in the human ventral temporal cortex (involved in high-level visual processing of complex stimuli). (6 subjs,12 runs per subj)
### Deliverable
