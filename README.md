# Image_decoding
Brain decoding or in the other word mind reading using neuroimaging data has been an active topic for years. It’s a neuroscience field that concerned on different type of stimuli from information that has already been encoded and represented in the brain by networks of neuron. WILL BE COMPLETED SOON….
## Summary
## Project definition
### Backgroung
### Tools
Python github and other tools which I am learning during braihack school
### Data
For brainhack school project i will use Haxby et al. (2001) data set which is a block-design fMRI dataset from a study on face & object representation in the human ventral temporal cortex (involved in high-level visual processing of complex stimuli). (6 subjs,12 runs per subj)
### Deliverable
