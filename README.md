# Brain_decoding
Brain decoding or mind-reading using neuroimaging data has been an active topic for years. It is a neuroscience field that concerned about different types of stimuli from information that has already been encoded and represented in the brain by networks of neurons. 
## Quick presentation
I am a first-year Master student in computer science at Université de Montréal. My Master's project is brain decoding and it is a part of a bigger project, the Courtois Neuromod. 
Since I am still in the early steps of my master’s project, my goal is to learn as much as possible and making use of several tools that we have learned during BHS training courses. For the BHS project I would like to run and compare the results of the different classifiers, (including Linear classifiers, Support vector machines, Random forests Decision trees, and Neural networks) for brain decoding on the Haxby dataset.
## Summary
### Backgroung

### Project definition
For the Brainhack School 2020 project I would like to work on the brain decoding model using an open-source dataset (Haxby) in order to evaluate decoding accuracy. (I am still not sure which model I am going to use!)
The goals of this project are:

•	Getting familiar with a brain decoding process in Python

•	Writing a Python-based machine learning/deep learning codes for this approach

•	Analyzing the results and see the difference for the different model using python plot

•	Moreover, trying to integrate as much as tools I was introduced during training week

I would like to work with other people, so please feel free to contact!

The README file will be updated daily!

### Tools
Python github and other tools which I am learning during braihack school
### Data
For brainhack school project i will use Haxby et al. (2001) data set which is a block-design fMRI dataset from a study on face & object representation in the human ventral temporal cortex (involved in high-level visual processing of complex stimuli). (6 subjs,12 runs per subj)
